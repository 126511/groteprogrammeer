Dit is chris z'n branch. Welcome! And have fun :)

- Loggin' in and out
- An index page for logged in users and for logged out ones
- A way to view and store HTML pages in the database, instead of having millions of HTML pages and thus dynamically generating the urls therefor
- Storing the latest page a user's visited
- Register users


WEBAPPS:
- files: show HTML files so that users can read them
- home: basic utils of the website, like loggin in and out and signing up
- docs: dynamically generate 



DOCS
- general documentation of functions and terms students have learned
- it dynamically updates when a student starts a new lesson, so that their documentation contains only the information they've learned or will learn in due time
- student are able to use a search function to query for their desired terms or function
- students are able to turn off the dynamic generation, so they can search for things they haven't learned yet.

USER HOME PAGE
- cards with news, marks, upcoming projects etc...
- Easily go to documentation, lessons, projects and more
- Other nifty features to make life easier
